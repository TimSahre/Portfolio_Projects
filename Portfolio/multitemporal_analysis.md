##  Automated analysis of coastal erosion on the North Siberian coast.

**Project description:** The project investigates the effects of global warming on the coastal areas of northern Siberia, which consist of permafrost soil and are therefore particularly susceptible to erosion. Two approaches are used for the automated analysis of coastal erosion: an analysis with radar data (Sentinel-1) and a multispectral analysis (Sentinel-2). Data acquisition and processing are automated using Python scripts, ERDAS IMAGINE and SNAP. Despite technical challenges, the project shows that continuous and accurate monitoring of coastal erosion is possible.
