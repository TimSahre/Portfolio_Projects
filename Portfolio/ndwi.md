**Project description:** The report "The Aral Sea & Lake Baikal" analyzes the changes in water masses of both lakes using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). It provides a detailed geographical and historical overview of both lakes, followed by a description of the data and methodology used. The results show significant water loss in the Aral Sea, while Lake Baikal, despite experiencing lesser changes, also faces environmental issues. The report concludes with a discussion on the ecological and socio-economic impacts as well as measures for restoration.
