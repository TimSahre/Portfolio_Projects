### A free and open sample dashboard that focuses on the impacts of climate change on our environment

<img src="images/kkn_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

The project explores the potential of interactive dashboards to convey the complexity of climate change impacts on hydrology, soil, and vegetation. It highlights the challenges of science communication in the digital age, with a particular focus on the critical evaluation of sources and the presentation of scientific data. Through the development and comparative analysis of dashboard solutions, the project aims to make scientific data accessible and understandable to the public. The importance of contextualization and user-centered design is emphasized to create dashboards that educate and engage the audience, fostering a deeper understanding of environmental issues.

### Automated Generation of Training Datasets for the Classification of Roads in Satellite Data Using a Convolutional Neural Network

<img src="images\cnn_training_data_thumbnail.jpg"/>

The project examined to what extent training data could be semi-automatically generated for a CNN and how the benefits of such an approach could be assessed. For this purpose, data products from satellite images as well as external datasets (such as road attributes from OSM datasets) were first generated. Subsequently, the appropriately merged dataset was used to train a CNN for feature detection (such as roads), and an analysis of the results regarding the advantages of a possible combination of satellite data and external data for the generation of training datasets was conducted.

### Impact of Exogenous Processes and Urban Structures on Natural Radiation in Berlin: Georeferencing, Data Cleaning, and GIS-based Analysis

<img src="images\lka_thumbnail.jpg"/>

The project addresses the impact of exogenous processes and urban components on natural radiation in Berlin. For the analysis, measurement data collected in Berlin were compared with reference data to examine radiation variations within the urban area. The main objective was to georeference, clean, and evaluate the measurement data, as well as to develop an appropriate evaluation method. The data were collected using a Natural-Background-Rejection (NBR) probe integrated into CBRN reconnaissance vehicles. These vehicles enable GPS-supported, continuous measurements, with data stored in a MySQL database and processed with JavaScript programs. Subsequently, the data were statistically analyzed and visualized in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Two main methods were applied: overlay and buffering, as well as interpolation using the Kriging method. The goal was to identify spatial trends and provide the most accurate area-wide estimation of radiation levels.

### Development of measurement technology for determining concrete cover, electrolytic concrete resistance, and potential field using an autonomous measurement platform

<img src="images/betoscan_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

The aim of the project was the development of an automated, non-destructive measurement system for detecting reinforcement steel corrosion. An established method for detecting corrosion probabilities is the quasi-non-destructive method of potential field measurement. As a previously little-researched, completely non-destructive variant of potential field measurement, this work focuses on differential potential field measurement. The differential potential field measurement is a probabilistic approach, whose significance can be increased by combining various measurement systems. Therefore, systems for recording the electrolytic concrete resistance and the concrete cover were also included in the work as important parameters regarding the interpretation of differential potential field measurements.
